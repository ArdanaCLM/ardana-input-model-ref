  disk-models:
  - name: MTRMON-DISKS

    # This example is based on using a single 500GB disk for a volume
    # group that contains all file systems on a controller with 64GB
    # of memory.
    #
    # Additional disks can be added to the 'physical-volumes' section.
    # 
    #

        physical-volumes:

          # NOTE: 'sda_root' is a templated value. This value is checked in
          # os-config and replaced by the partition actually used on sda
          #e.g. sda1 or sda5
          - /dev/sda_root

          # Add any additional disks for the volume group here
          # -/dev/sdx
          # -/dev/sdy

        logical-volumes:
          # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
          # 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
