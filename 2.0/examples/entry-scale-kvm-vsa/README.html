<p>This example separates network traffic into four logical networks which are carried on a pair of bonded physical ports.</p>

<p><b>Logical network separation:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>External API - used by consumers of the cloud to make requests to the cloud APIs</li>
<li>External VM - used to provide external access to VMs (via floating IP addresses)</li>
<li>Guest - carries traffic between VMs on private networks within the cloud (VxLAN encapsulated)</li>
<li>Management - used for all internal traffic between the cloud services. This network is also used to provision and configure the cloud servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In addition, each server is connected to a dedicated IPMI/iLO network. This is used for power management during installation.
