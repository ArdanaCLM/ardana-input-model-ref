# Ardana OpenStack will create firewall rules to enable the required access for
# all of the deployed services. Use this section to define any
# additional access.
#
# Each group of rules can be applied to one or more network groups
# Examples are given for ping and ssh
#
# Names of rules, (e.g. "PING") are arbitrary and have no special significance
#
