    # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
    # 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
